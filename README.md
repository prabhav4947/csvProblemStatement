# csvProblemStatement

The two files awards.php and contracts.php give a html table view of the csv/awards.csv and csv/contracts.php respectively.

merge_awards_contracts.php is the main script where the two csv files awards and contracts are merged, resulting in a new file creation named final.csv

Please run merge_awards_contracts.php to get final.csv
(the final.csv output is created with all columns and rows intact, however a runtime error still occurs, which is undefined Offset)

view_final.php file can be used to view final.csv file in html table format.
